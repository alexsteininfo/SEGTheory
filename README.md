This repository provides the code for the paper "Stackelberg Evolutionary Game Theory: How to Manage Evolving Systems".

The paper can be found [this link](https://doi.org/0000000000). (The link will be updated as soon as the paper is published.)

The files are divided into the folders

- **Figures** that contains the code for the generation of the figures.
