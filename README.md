# Stackelberg Evolutionary Game Theory
 
This repository provides codes that have been used in the paper "Stackelberg Evolutionary Game Theory: How to Manage Evolving Systems" (**Proceedings of the Royal Society B**, 2023). The paper can be found in [this link](https://doi.org/0000000000). (The link will be updated as soon as the paper is published.)

The code files are divided into the folders:
- **Fishery** contains calculations with Mathematica for the fishery application. These can also be used as template to solve an eco-evolutionary system as well as the Stackelberg and Nash strategies
- **Cancer**  contains the code that has been used for the cancer application
